# BNA's Not Assembly
BNA is an assembly-inspired programming language designed to keep things strict and simple. Operations are atomic, and the syntax is *close* to English. See the wiki for more information.

## Pronunciation
BNA is meant to be pronounced as 'banana', but feel free to call it 'buh-nah' or just 'BNA'.
The acronym takes inspiration from other recursive acronyms, primarily GNU (GNU's Not Unix).
